#üêß Day 1, PM practical - More advanced shell


##To begin:
After logging into Hydra, navigate to the directory you created this morning at `/pool/cluster0/workshop/<username>`

*Hint: Day 1 AM Practical Step 3*


### 1. Using Core utilities

> A. grep: globally search a regular expression and print

- `man grep`Ùè∞Ä Everything you need to know. Ùè∞Ä

- `grep 'EAS' sequences.fa`
- `grep 'Contig' sequences.fa`
- `grep 'contig' sequences.fa`

- grep -i : grep,case insensitive
`grep -i 'contig' sequences.fa`

- grep -r: recursive grep
`grep -r 'Contig' ./`

- You may also combine options, e.g.:`grep -ir 'conTIG' ./`

- grep -A: show lines after the grep hit
`grep -i -A 1 'contig' sequences.fa` Useful if the sequences are in one line. Ùè∞Ä

	- Also try:  
		- `grep -B 10 '<searchterm>' <filename>` (10 lines Before)Ùè∞Ä
		- `grep -C 5 '<searchterm>' <filename>` (5 lines of Context)
		- Combinations are possible: `grep -A 1 -B 2 '<searchterm>' <filename>` (1 line After, 2 lines Before the hit)

> 	B. Output redirection: > (write to file)- `grep 'Contig' sequences.fa > selection.fa`Ùè∞ÄCreates a file,if it does not exists.Ùè∞ÄWrites the output into the file. *Caution: existing content will be overwritten. Do not write to the same file that you read from.*

- `grep 'Contig' sequences.fa >> selection.fa`Ùè∞ÄCreates a file, if it does not exists.Ùè∞ÄAppends the output to the end of thef ile.Ùè∞ÄExisting content is not overwritten. Rather, the file grows. (You should still not write to the same file that you read from.)

> 	C. sed: stream editor

- Add taxa name to end of all header lines:

	`sed 's/>.*/& Escherichia coli/' sequences.fa > outfile_sed.fa`

	D. awk: 'awk' stands for the names of its authors ‚ÄúAho, Weinberger, and Kernighan‚Äù
	
- Clean up a fasta file so only first column of the header is outputted:

	`awk '{print $1}' outfile_sed.fa > output_awk.fa`

### 2. Working with FASTA files

>	A. wc: count number of lines, words, characters

- Mnemonic: wc ‚Üí word count. `-l ` (for counting lines) is the most commonly used option. More information: `man wc`.

- **Exercise: sequence count**

	- Find a way to output the number of Sequences in a FASTA file.
You may use ‚Äòtemporary' files.Tip: individual sequences are identified by their headers. Header lines in a FASTA file begin with ‚Äò>'.

		- **Possible solutions: sequence count**		`man grep`		`grep -c '>' sequences.fa`

			`grep '>' sequences.fa > tempfile.txt`
`wc -l tempfile.txt`

> B. Output redirection: | (pipe)- `ls -1 | wc -l`Ùè∞Ä 
‚ÄòPipes' the output of  `ls -1` into the input of `wc -l`. Ùè∞Ä Prints out the number of items in this directory.Ùè∞Ä No temporary file necessary.

- `grep '>' sequences.fa | less`Ùè∞Ä 'Pipes' the output of grep into the input of less.Ùè∞Ä Allows to comfortably read the list of headers in a FASTA file. Ùè∞Ä No temporary file necessary.
 
	- Displayed using  less:Ùè∞ÄSearch using `/`Ùè∞ÄQuit with `q`

- **Exercise: filter;**Ùè∞Ä Output the first five headers in a FASTA file

	- Possible solution: `grep '>' sequences.fa | head -n 5`

- **Exercise: one specific line;**
Output line number 19 of a given file.
	- Possible solution: `head -n 19 sequences.fa | tail -n 1`- **Exercise: collecting sequences;**Ùè∞Ä Save the first three and the last three headers from a FASTA file in a new file.Ùè∞Ä This cannot be solved (easily) with only one command.

	- Possible solution: 
`grep '>' sequences.fa | head -n 3 > newfile.fa` and`grep '>' sequences.fa | tail -n 3 >> newfile.fa`

###3.Managing Files

> A. tar: tape archive

`tar -cvf new_tar_archive.tar <list>`
- Mnemonic: `tar` ‚Üí tape archive Ùè∞Ä 
-  `c`: create new archive-  `v`: verbose output-  `f`: file to use; can take files and directories as arguments

- **Exercise: create a tar archive;**
	- `tar -cvf sequences.tar sequences.fa`

Show the content of a tar archive:`tar -tvf new_tar_archive.tar`

Unpack a tar archive:`tar -xvf tar_archive.tar`

- **Exercise: unpack a tar archive;**
	- `tar -xvf sequences.tar`

> B. gzip: compress files

- **Exercise: compress fasta file;**
	- `ls -lh sequences.fa`
	- `gzip sequences.fa`	- `ls -lh sequences.fa.gz`Compression reduces file size. Useful for copying over network, Mail attachments, storing on removable media, . . .- **Uncompress:**`gzip -d sequences.fa.gz` 
Mnemonic: `d` ‚Üí decompressÙè∞Ä 

###4. Transfer a file from /pool/cluster0/workshop/ to your local computer
> A. scp: secure copy

`scp [options] <username1>@source_host:/directory1/filename1 <username2>@distination_host:/directory2/filename2`

- Name of the account on the host computer (username1)
- [options] 

	- `-p` for preserve time info (can be very helpful to keep track of what is what)
	- `-r` copy directory
- Hostname of the computer on which the source file resides (source_host = hydra-login01)
- Name of the directory containing the source file (directory1)
- Filename of the source file (filename1)
- The location to which the source file will be copied is specified by username2@destination_host:directory2/filename2, which includes the:
	- Name of the account on the destination computer (username2)
	- Hostname of the computer to which the source file will be copied (destination_host)
	- Name of the directory to which the source file will be copied (directory2)
	- Filename of the copy (filename2)

- For more information: `man scp`

- **Exercise: compress and transfer to your local computer**	
	- In hydra-3: `gzip sequences.fa` 
	- Open a new terminal session/window
	- Confirm that you are on your local computer:`ls`
	- In local terminal: `scp -p <username>@hydra-login01:/pool/cluster0/workshop/<username>/Day1/data/sequences.fa.gz ./`
	- Confirm that the file has been transfered: `ls`
	
	***Note: Windows users do not have a built-in scp program. Try Cyberduck, Filezilla...***
