#üêú Day 1, AM Practical##Basic Unix Command Line Skill##Prerequisites:- Hydra account - Paul will be setting up Hydra accounts for and giving initial passwords. Your username will be the same as your SI email username but the passwords are not synchronized.- A connection to si-staff wireless, a wired connection on the SI LAN, or an active VPN connection.##Goals:- Log into Hydra with your new user account- Get experience with the command line for manipulation and viewing of files- Get experience finding help on Hydra and the web for commands***Note:*** Lines that start with a `$` should be entered on the command line without the  `$`**Want answers?** We don‚Äôt give the exact command for all exercises. We encourage you to spend time figuring these out, but if you get stuck on a step, a complete log of all the exercises is here: `https://gist.github.com/mkweskin/52626f5320e899e191d4` ( or `bit.ly/hydra-day1am-answers`).**1a. Hydra login (Mac users)**- Open the Terminal application (in /Applications/Utilities/)- `$ ssh <username>@hydra-login01.si.edu` (<username> is your hydra username)- If prompted about the "authenticity of the host" type "yes"- Enter your hydra password when prompted (Paul will tell you your initial password)- Questions: How can you tell you are now on hydra? What folder are you in when you first login?**1b. Hydra login (Windows users)**- Start PuTTY (http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe)- In the configuration window for "Host Name" enter hydra-3.si.edu and click "Open"- If prompted about the "server's host key" click "yes"- At the "login as: " prompt enter your hydra username and then your hydra password when prompted- You're now at the same screen that Mac users see from their terminal application- Question: How can you tell you are now on hydra? What folder are you in when you first login?**2. Change your password (first login and then every 90 days)**- `$ passwd` Enter your current password and then your new password two times. Password rules are the same as your SI email account (‚â•8 characters, ‚â•1 number, ‚â•1 special character, not previously used).- On Hydra *you need to change you password in two locations.* 	- `$ ssh hydra-3` 	- `$ passwd`  use your initial password and then the same new password as the previous step.	- `$ exit` to return to hydra-login-01. We‚Äôll be talking about the two servers later.**3. Change to `/pool/cluster0/workshop` and make a folder**- Your data are stored in one of the `/pool` folders rather than your home folder. `/pool` is connected to the network storage on Hydra for high-speed access to all the computers on the cluster. For this training we will be using `/pool/cluster0` - `$ cd /pool/cluster0/workshop` - `$ mkdir <username>` This will be where your workshop documents will be stored.- `$ ls` to your folder and everyone else‚Äôs- `$ cd <username>` change into your directory**4. Copy the sample data**- This directory has today‚Äôs sample data: `/pool/cluster0/workshop/Hydra_workshop_2015/Day1`- use `cp` to copy the directory `Day1` and its contents to your new folder `/pool/cluster0/workshop/<username>`	- *We‚Äôre not giving the exact command line here.* Use your cheat sheet to find the `cp` *option to copy an entire directory*. The format of the `cp` command is`cp [options] source destination` For the destination use `.` to copy to the current folder. Did you use an absolute path or a relative path for source and destination? - `$ ls -l` to confirm that the folder copied successfully. You should see the `Day1` folder.- Error about `‚Ä¶omitting directory‚Ä¶`? Check the cheat sheet for the `cp` option to copy a whole directory.**5. Viewing file contents**- Use `cd` to change the directory to `Day1` and then change again into `data` which has the sequence files we‚Äôll be using. Use `$ ls -l` to confirm that the two `sequences.fa` and `sequences.fq` are there.- Try all four of these commands to examine the file `sequences.fa`	
	a)	`$ cat sequences.fa`	
	b)	`$ head sequences.fa`	
	c)	`$ tail sequences.fa`	
	d)	`$ less sequences.fa`   (Remember, `q` is quit in less)	
	e)	Use `less` to *find the sequences* that contains the description EAS20_ 8_ 6_ 1_  5_388 (Type `h` in less for help screen, look for ‚ÄúSearch forward‚Ä¶‚Äù in the ‚ÄúSEARCHING‚Äù section.).	
	f)	Use `head` to display the first sequence only (first two lines). Type `$ man head` (or Google) to find the option to limit the number of lines `head` displays (man pages open in `less`, use the arrow keys to navigate and `q` to quit).	
	g)	Use `tail` and wildcard globbing to display the last 10 lines *of the two sequences files* (`sequences.fa` and `sequences.fq`) with one command.**6. Edit a file with `nano`**- Open `sequences.fa` with `nano`- Change some bases in one of the sequences. We'll need this file in the afternoon so keep it valid fasta.- Save and close the file*Remember in* `nano` *shortcuts are at the bottom of the screen and* `^` *is the control key.***7. Create a new text file and delete it**- `$ nano newfile` If the filename doesn‚Äôt exist, an empty document will be opened.- Enter some text into the file, save it and exit.- Use one of the text viewing commands we used in Step 5 to view your new file‚Äôs contents.- After viewing your file delete it with the `rm` command**8. Find the hidden file! (extra credit)**- Return to the ‚Äúparent‚Äù folder, `Day1` (remember that `..` refers to the parent directory). Use the `ls` option that shows hidden files and then `cat` the file a pre-lunch treat.**9. Exit the hydra ssh session**- `$ exit` to close the connection to hydra. It‚Äôs best practice to always do this.#Digging deeper (optional for more advanced users):#1.	Want to learn the `vi` editor? Enter the command $ vimtutor on Hydra or your Mac for a tutorial. To exit type `:q`2.	Want to learn the `emacs` editor? Do the emacs tutorial by starting `$ emacs` and then `<control+h>` and then `t`. To exit type `<control+x>` and then `<control+c>`.3.	Using  `$ ls -l` Compare the creation date of the original file and the one you copied. Check the `cp` man page or online resources to learn how to copy the file and preserve the original create date.4.	When you use `less` to view the fasta file, the lines automatically wrap ("fold" in `less` lingo) which can be annoying for fasta files with long sequences. What flag for less will stop this so the lines don't wrap ("chop" in `less` lingo)? Hint: this is an option when starting `less` rather than a command when `less` is already running.
